# Implementation of the working column

## 0. Introduction

In order to test out the different prototypes of sensors and algorithms in a controlled environment, we decided to build two physical models of rivers, for 1D and pseudo-2D testing.

The column model is reserved for 1D testing, and has its pros and cons :

- Pros :
        - easier to build than 2D model
        - requires simpler equipment than 2D model
        - accurate for 1D sensor calibration and testing

- Cons : 
        - requires to detach sensors from MOLONARI device in order to fit them on a thinner rod to avoid edge effects (linked to the small distance between the surface of the column and the surface of the regular MOLONARI device rod)
        - only 1D modelling

## 1. Design 

The model should work as follows : a pump induces vertical water flow throughout the porous material in the column, all the parameters should be known prior to testing. The sensors are planted inside the material at the distances required for testing (for temperature sensors, every 10cm, and for the differential pressure sensor, at the bottom and top of the porous material). 


### Equipment required : 

- plastic tube (Ø60mm approx.) with a cap on one side
- a pump
- plastic tubing to link the column to the pump
- a brass barbed fitting
- MOLONARI device
- a piece of fabric to act as a filter to not clog the pump at the bottom
- your porous material of choice (sand, beads, gravel...)

- tools to cut into plastic (small saw, cutter, a drill bit adapted to the size of your barbed fitting...)

### Construction instructions : 

- To keep things simple, we recycled a plastic ion exchanger tube (Ø60mm) with its plastic cap on one side. 

- We made a hole in the cap in order to fit a brass barbed fitting at the bottom of the column, which enables water flow through the porous material. 

- In order not to clog the pump with the porous material, we put a piece of fabric on top of the barbed fitting, at the bottom of the column to filter the water flow. We kept it in place using a small piece from a smaller plastic tube and the weight of the sand and marbles we use to model the porous material.
