# MOLONARI1D LoRa Receiver Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete LoRa receiver system that emulates the MOLONARI1D LoRaWan receiver functionality as requested in issue #191.

## Implementation Details

### New Components Added

1. **`lora_receiver.py`** - Core receiver implementation
   - `LoRaReceiver` class for basic packet reception and processing
   - `LoRaWANReceiver` class for LoRaWAN relay functionality  
   - `ReceivedPacket` dataclass for received packet metadata

2. **`example_lora_receiver.py`** - Comprehensive demonstration
   - Shows complete emitter->receiver->gateway data flow
   - Demonstrates all receiver features including MQTT integration

3. **`demo_lora_receiver.py`** - Simple feature demonstration
   - Quick overview of key receiver capabilities

4. **`test_lora_receiver.py`** - Complete test suite
   - 20 test cases covering all receiver functionality
   - Integration tests for emitter-receiver communication

### Key Features Implemented

#### âœ… Core Requirements (from issue #191)
- **Receives LoRa packets** transmitted by `lora_emitter.py` 
- **Adds receiving timestamp** to the dataflux
- **Emits updated package via LoRaWAN** towards the gateway
- **MQTT integration** for IoT connectivity
- **Mimics data transmission** between emitter and receiver following LoRaWan protocol

#### âœ… Additional Features
- **Packet acknowledgments** (ACK protocol as in Arduino code)
- **Reception simulation** with realistic RSSI/SNR values
- **Packet queuing** and batch processing
- **CSV data persistence** with full metadata
- **Comprehensive statistics** and monitoring
- **Error handling** and recovery mechanisms
- **Configurable reception rates** for testing

### Technical Implementation

#### Reception Simulation
```python
# Realistic packet reception with signal quality simulation
def simulate_packet_reception(self, transmitted_packet) -> Optional[ReceivedPacket]:
    # Considers RSSI, SNR, spreading factor for reception success
    # Returns ReceivedPacket with metadata or None if failed
```

#### Timestamp Addition
```python
# Adds precise reception timestamp to payload
def add_reception_timestamp(self, received_packet) -> str:
    # Format: "original_payload,RX_TIME:2024-11-07 10:00:12.123"
```

#### LoRaWAN Forwarding
```python
# Forwards received data via LoRaWAN to gateway
def forward_via_lorawan(self, received_packet) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Creates new packet with reception timestamp
    # Transmits via LoRaWAN emitter to gateway
```

#### MQTT Integration  
```python
# Publishes sensor data to MQTT broker in JSON format
def publish_to_mqtt(self, received_packet) -> bool:
    # Structured JSON payload with all metadata
    # Configurable broker and topic settings
```

### Protocol Compliance

The implementation follows the MOLONARI1D protocol specifications:

- **Packet structure** matches Arduino MKR WAN 1310 format
- **Request types** include data (0xc3), ACK (0xac), relay (0xc4)  
- **Address scheme** supports 8-bit device addresses
- **Checksum validation** for packet integrity
- **Duty cycle compliance** for LoRaWAN transmission

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Reception
```python
from pyheatmy import LoRaEmitter, LoRaReceiver

emitter = LoRaEmitter(device_address=0x05)
receiver = LoRaReceiver(device_address=0x01)

# Transmit and receive
tx_result = emitter.simulate_transmission(packet)
rx_packet = receiver.simulate_packet_reception(tx_result)

# Add timestamp and process
updated_payload = receiver.add_reception_timestamp(rx_packet)
```

#### LoRaWAN Relay
```python
from pyheatmy import LoRaWANReceiver

receiver = LoRaWANReceiver(
    device_address=0x01,
    app_eui="0000000000000001",
    mqtt_config={'broker': 'mqtt.example.com', 'topic': 'sensors/data'}
)

# Start relay operation
receiver.start_relay_operation()

# Process packets automatically or manually
processed = receiver.process_received_packets(
    packet_processor=receiver.relay_packet_processor
)
```

### Testing and Validation

- **20 comprehensive test cases** covering all functionality
- **Integration tests** for emitter-receiver communication
- **Error condition testing** (queue overflow, join failures, etc.)
- **Statistics validation** and CSV persistence testing
- **MQTT integration testing** (graceful degradation when unavailable)

### Dependencies Added

- **paho-mqtt>=1.6.0** for MQTT integration
- Updated `pyproject.toml` accordingly

### Files Modified/Added

**New Files:**
- `pyheatmy/pyheatmy/lora_receiver.py` (764 lines)
- `pyheatmy/example_lora_receiver.py` (386 lines) 
- `pyheatmy/demo_lora_receiver.py` (130 lines)
- `pyheatmy/tests/test_lora_receiver.py` (485 lines)

**Modified Files:**
- `pyheatmy/pyheatmy/__init__.py` - Added receiver imports
- `pyheatmy/pyproject.toml` - Added MQTT dependency

## Verification

### Test Results
```bash
# All receiver tests pass
python -m unittest tests.test_lora_receiver -v
# Ran 20 tests in 19.973s - OK

# Original emitter tests still pass  
python -m unittest tests.test_lora_emitter -v
# Ran 21 tests in 43.673s - OK
```

### Demo Results
```bash
python demo_lora_receiver.py
# âœ“ All core functionality working
# ðŸŽ‰ LoRa receiver system ready for MOLONARI1D deployment!
```
