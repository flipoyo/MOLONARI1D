# ReadMe on how to design a metal box for 5 thermometers and 1 pressure sensor. 

## Materials : 

- Metalic box
- Screws :
    - 1 component
    - 3 components 
- Glue : ...
- ...

## Protocol : 

### Step 1 : 

Draw the spots where to make the holes. Here are the dimensions : 

- On the widest faces : 
    - Face 1 : $4.5 cm$ from the bottom, first spot at $2 cm$ from the left, then $4.1 cm$ 3 times and then it should be remaining $2 cm$ from the edge.
    - Face 3 : $4.5 cm$ from the bottom, a unique spot at $10 cm$ from the left, which should be $6.5 cm$ from the edge.

- On the narrowest faces : 
    - Faces 2 & 4 (same) : $4.5 cm$ from the bottom, a unique spot at $5.8 cm$ from the left.

### Step 2 : 

#### Holes for the thermometers : 

Pre-drill holes with the Dremel using two different drill bit sizes: the smallest one first, then the next size up... Next, use the drill and drill by hand to enlarge the pre-drilled hole with... Finally, tap with the three different taps—sizes...—to deepen the hole.
