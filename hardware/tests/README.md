   # Verify packet reception at various distances
   ```

2. **Protocol Validation**
   ```bash
   # Upload Sensor_Lora.ino to sensor device
   # Upload Relay_Lora.ino to relay device
   # Test three-way handshake protocol
   ```

3. **Power Management**
   ```bash
   # Upload testArduinoLowPower.ino
   # Measure current consumption in all modes
   # Validate sleep/wake cycles
   ```

4. **Network Integration**
   ```bash
   # Upload testArduinoLoRaWAN.ino
   # Configure gateway credentials
   # Test end-to-end connectivity
   ```
