# Sample payload transmission

This is ...


## Material we used
- Arduino MKR WAN 1310
- Robustel R3000-LG4LA Gateway
- Tension generator (we used 15V, but the Robustel supports from 9 to 60 V)
- 2 ethernet cables (one to connect the gateway to the network and the other one to configure it with the computer)
- MicroUSB cable for the Arduino controller
- Ethernet to usb adapter, because our laptops did not have an Ethernet connection.
