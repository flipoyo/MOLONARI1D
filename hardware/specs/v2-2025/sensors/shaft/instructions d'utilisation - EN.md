# Instructions about the conception and printing of the MoLoNaRi shaft

This directory contains files relative to the different printable versions of the MoLoNaRi shaft. For each version, you will find the file in ready-to-print stl format, as well as the files that were used for its conception, either via the online software *OnShape*, or via the software *Autodesk Fusion*.

## Screwed shaft 

The screwed shaft was created to be printable with small 3D printers (starting at a 25cm height). The shaft must be printed in three parts, that screw onto one another. This creates weakness points, the parts must be screwed onto one another carefully, and very straight, until the sensors' placements are properly aligned. This limits the internal diameter to 4mm, as opposed to the 8mm of the screw-less version, in order to strengthen the connections.

### Instructions for printing :

Print the 3 files located at ```tige à vis/fichiers stl (pour l'impression)```. We used polylite ASA as our testing material, with 50% filling. **Before printing**, one must ensure that no support is printed inside the screw inserts (given they're quite long, it can be hard to remove supports afterwards).

Once printed, **carefully** screw the different parts as straight as possible. No need to apply excessive force, the sensor and cable spots should align similarly to what is done for the central part.

To waterproof the shaft, apply a layer of epoxy resin, especially between the pieces. **Careful not to fill in the gaps at the bottom of the shaft, which allows for water to infiltrate. The resin might run down the end piece during the drying phase if put to dry vertically, and affect the sharpness of the ribs where the hosepipe is plugged : this might make the connection non water-proof.
