# Shaft design V2

This directory contains the specifications for the single shaft of the v2 of the MOLONARI1D device, developped by the MOLONARI2025 team.

## Purpose

This single shaft was developed in order to improve the v1 system’s shaft by combining the temperature and the pressure systems into one unique shaft. We had to ensure that the new shaft design was enough resilient. 

We had several constraints to develop this new version of the shaft. Indeed, we had the constraint of the **diameter of the crowbar**, used to make the hole in the ground (our shaft had to has a lower diameter to fit in the hole); then the **porosity at the end of the shaft**, which has to let water come inside the shaft, but not the pebbles, sned or other particules, that would block the shaft; the **connection to the hosepipe** at the top of the shaft and of course the **resistance and waterproofing** of the shaft that should be designed to remain underground the river for several months.
