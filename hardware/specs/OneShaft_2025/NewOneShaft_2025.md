# Shaft design V2

**Purpose :**
Improving the systemâ€™s shaft by combining the temperature and the pressure systems into one unique shaft and ensuring that it is enough resilient. 

**New design :** 
The new design is constituted of a plastic tube and printed rings with spots for the thermometers are designed, to glue around the tube. 
At the top of the shaft, a fluted connector allows the pipe to be connected to the shaft. In order to ensure there is no loss in hydraulic load between the shaft and the sensors, it is necessary to ensure maximal watertightness when it comes to this connection (as well as the material used to make the shaft). Resin should be added after printing to ensure full waterproofness.  
At the bottom of the shaft, ... 
Holes need to be made in the tube, at the end of the shaft, next to the spot for the deepest thermometer.
