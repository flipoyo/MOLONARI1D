#  ![logo](Figures/logo_MOLONARI_smll.png)  MOLONARI1D ecosystem

MOLONARI means MOnitoring LOcal des √©changes NAppe-RIvi√®re, which translates in English to LOcal MOnitoring of Stream-aquifer exchanges (LOMOS).

The MOLONARI1D ecosystem is a comprehensive **environmental monitoring solution** for water and heat exchanges in riverbed environments. It provides end-to-end monitoring from hardware deployment to scientific analysis, enabling long-term autonomous data collection in challenging aquatic environments.

## System Architecture

MOLONARI1D implements a **multi-tier monitoring architecture** designed for scalable, autonomous environmental monitoring:

```
Underwater Sensors ‚Üí Relay ‚Üí Gateway ‚Üí Server ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Analysis Tools
     (Arduino)       (LoRa)  (LoRaWAN)  (Internet) (SQL)   (Python ML/GUI)
```

**Data Flow Pipeline:**
1. **Field Sensors**: Battery-powered Arduino devices collect temperature/pressure every 15min
2. **Local Communication**: Custom LoRa protocol transmits sensor data to relay daily
3. **Wide Area Network**: LoRaWAN gateway forwards data to internet-connected server
4. **Quality Control**: Server database processes and validates incoming sensor data - backend of Molonaviz
5. **Analysis Interface**: GUI manages devices and launches scientific computing - frontend of Molonaviz
6. **Scientific Inference**: pyheatmy performs Bayesian MCMC inversion for flux estimation

## Warning on Reliability

This version of MOLONARI1D is a development version. Some features are not yet implemented or are incomplete. Some bugs may also appear. We therefore do not guarantee any reliability on the resulting values of the calculations, however the data format will remain constant during their full implementation. Think of this code as a template that will remain persistent when the features are reliable in their results.

## Get the sources

Due to the large history of commits, cloning the repositroy may need to be performed using "Shallow clone" option:

`git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/flipoyo/MOLONARI1D.git`


## Virtual environments for linux

### 1. **Using `pyenv` to Manage Multiple Versions of Python**

`pyenv` is a convenient tool for installing and managing multiple versions of Python on your Ubuntu system. Installing `pyenv`:

1.1. **Install the necessary dependencies:**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
   ```

1.2. **Install `pyenv`:**

   You can install `pyenv` using the official installation script:

   ```bash
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash
   ```

   Follow the on-screen instructions to add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` file (or `~/.zshrc` if you use `zsh`):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
   eval "$(pyenv init -)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
   ```

   Reload your shell configuration file with `source ~/.bashrc` or open a new terminal.

1.3. **Install a specific version of Python:**

   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.10.12
   ```

   Replace `3.10.12` with the version of Python you want to install.

1.4. **Set the global default Python version:**

   ```bash
   pyenv global 3.10.12
   ```

   To change the Python version for a specific project, navigate to the project directory and use:

   ```bash
   pyenv local 3.10.12
   ```


### 2. **Using Virtual Environments**

To manage project-specific dependencies, you can create a virtual environment with `venv` or `virtualenv`:

```bash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Then, you can install Python packages without affecting other projects.


## Virtual environments for windows

Use anaconda, download it install it.

open the anaconda prompt terminal in windows. Install git for anaconda:

Install gitlab for conda:

```bash
> conda install -c anaconda git
```

And create a virtual environment

```bash
> conda create --name py3.11.4 -c anaconda python=3.11.4
```

Activate the virtual environment

```bash
> conda activate py3.11.4
```

Run the MOLONARI installation process from there. You can launch molonaviz from there.

For developpers, run code . from there to be sure to be in the proper environment

Deactivate the virtual environment 


```bash
> conda deactivate
```
