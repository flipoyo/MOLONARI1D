#  ![logo](Figures/logo_MOLONARI_smll.png)  MOLONARI1D ecosystem

MOLONARI stands for "**mo**nitoring **lo**cal des échanges **na**ppe-**ri**vière", which translates in English to **lo**cal **mo**nitoring of **s**tream-aquifer exchanges (LOMOS). This project aims to develop a comprehensive environmental monitoring solution for **water and heat exchanges* * in riverbed environments. 

This repository provides detailed descriptions and scripts on how to build, prepare and deploy a 1D MOLONARI device, from hardware deployment to scientific analysis. A MOLONARI1D device provides **temperature and pressure sensors** in the river bed, at depths ranging from 0 to ~40cm. In the long run, these measures give us informations on water and heat exchanges between the river and the aquifer, and on the aquifer's properties (porosity, permeability, etc.)

**Key attention points** - The MOLONARI1D device is designed with the following key concepts in mind :
- low-tech production
- open-source and replicability
- scalability

## Core Components

Here is an overview of the main features developed so far in the MOLONARI1D project.

### 🔧 **Hardware** - MOLONARI1D Devices Ecosystem
*Arduino-based underwater sensors network*

- **Sensor Nodes**: Waterproof packages with temperature/pressure sensors
- **Relay Stations**: Data aggregation and LoRaWAN communication
- **Communication Protocols**: Custom LoRa (local) + LoRaWAN (wide-area)
- **Power Management**: 8-12 months autonomous operation

### 🔬 **pyheatmy** - Scientific Computing Engine
*Bayesian inference for hydrological parameter estimation*

- **Bayesian inversion, MCMC based**: Infers physical properties of 1D riverbed columns - multichain MCMC also available
- **Data Integration**: Direct coupling with sensor data streams from monitoring systems
- **Uncertainty Quantification**: Provides parameter estimates with confidence intervals
- **Research Extensions**: Modular architecture supporting experimental features

### 📊 **Molonaviz** - Device Management & Visualization  
*PyQt5-based GUI for operational monitoring*

- **Device Registration**: Laboratory and sampling point hierarchy management
- **Data Pipeline**: Quality control workflows from raw sensor data to analysis-ready datasets
- **Analysis Integration**: Direct launching of pyheatmy inference workflows

**⚠️ Requirements**: Python 3.10+ for Molonaviz, Python 3.9+ for pyheatmy

## Network Architecture

MOLONARI1D implements a **multi-tier monitoring network architecture** designed for scalable, autonomous environmental monitoring.

**Data Flow Pipeline:**

```
Underwater Sensors → Relay → Gateway → Server → Database → Analysis Tools
     (Arduino)       (LoRa)  (LoRaWAN)  (Internet) (SQL)   (Python ML/GUI)
```

1. **Field Sensors**: Battery-powered Arduino devices collect temperature/pressure every 15min
2. **Local Communication**: Custom LoRa protocol transmits sensor data to relay daily
3. **Wide Area Network**: LoRaWAN gateway forwards data to internet-connected server
4. **Quality Control**: Server database processes and validates incoming sensor data - backend of Molonaviz
5. **Analysis Interface**: GUI manages devices and launches scientific computing - frontend of Molonaviz
6. **Scientific Inference**: pyheatmy performs Bayesian MCMC inversion for flux estimation

## Warning on reliability

This version of MOLONARI1D is a development version. Some features are not yet implemented or are incomplete.
Some bugs may also appear. We therefore do not guarantee any reliability on the resulting values of the calculations, however the data format will remain constant during their full implementation. Think of this code as a template that will remain persistent when the features are reliable in their results.

## Recent Improvements (December 2024)

🚀 **Enhanced Development Workflows**: Comprehensive repository reorganization with team-oriented structure, consolidated shared libraries, and automated CI/CD validation for all components.

📚 **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added 15+ README files for Arduino sketches, complete API documentation (MOLONARI1D_API.md), and integration guides between hardware and software components.

🔧 **Improved Hardware Integration**: Better integration between the original `Device/` structure and new organized `hardware/` directory, with clear migration paths and backward compatibility.

✅ **Quality Assurance**: Fixed CI issues, validated all test suites, and ensured robust development workflows for multi-team collaboration.
