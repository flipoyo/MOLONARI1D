# Understanding our sensor code

Work of MOLONARI2024 team but the folders are not up-to-date, merge what need to be merged in files 1 to 5, and reorganize

## Introduction
Since this project is intended to be developed and improved each year by a new group of students, we created this document to explain the structure and functionality of the main sensor code and its associated classes. This document serves as a general guide to understanding the sensor code (.ino), detailing the organization and purpose of each file, class (.cpp and .hpp), and main function. The aim is to make future modifications or improvements easier to implement and understand.

## Main code: Riviere_2024.ino
This code is uploaded to our Arduino board and contains the setup and main loop of our system. It manages the overall workflow and calls the necessary classes. 

### Initialization
* Configurations. Here we define the data type for measurements, specifie a function for parsing measurements as TO_MEASURE_T, and include options to enable diagnostic logging for LoRa operations and SD card operations.
* Imports. Be sure you are including the necessary header files and source files for the sensor firmware.
* Main Variables. This section declares:
 - The CSPin constant, which specifies the chip select pin for the SD card and is set to pin 5 in this case. You can change this to another unused pin number, but it should not be set to pin 6 (see the installation guide). In simple terms, this pin establishes communication between the microcontroller and the SD card.
 - An instance of the Writer class named logger, which facilitates writing measurement data to a CSV file
 - The filename for this CSV file is defined as RIVIERE.CSV
 - Four instances of the Temp_Sensor class are initialized, each assigned to a specific analog pin (A1, A2, A3, A4) and given unique identifiers (1, 2, 3, 4)

### Setup()
In the setup function, the initialization of various system components is performed. First, the LED is enabled and lights up to indicate that the system is ready to start. Next, the serial communication is established and the system waits up to 5 seconds for the connection to be established, during which time it remains in an idle loop.

The LoRa communication is then initialized. "Initialising LoRa‚Äù is printed to indicate the start of this process. 

The SD card is initialized using CSPin. If successful, a confirmation message is displayed; if not, an error message appears, interrupts are disabled, and the system enters an infinite loop to halt further operations.

With the SD card ready, the logger establishes a connection and the RTC is initialized, confirmed by a serial message.

Finally, a message is printed indicating that the initialization is complete. Before the end of the function, the LED goes off indicating that the system is ready for operation.

In summary, once the set up is initialized and before starting the loop, the serial monitor should look like this:

*Initialising LoRa*
*Done*
*Initialising SD card*
*Done*
*Loading log file ...*
*Done*
*Initialising RTC ...*
*Done*
*Initialisation complete !*

### Loop()
First, it performs an initial setup that turns on the integrated LED and establishes serial communication to make sure the system is ready. Next, it initializes the key components of the system, such as LoRa, the SD card, the logger and the real-time clock (RTC). Once all are configured, the LED turns off and the system goes into low-power mode while waiting for the necessary time before the first measurement.

The main cycle flow is designed to take readings at specific intervals of 15 minutes. If the system has just started, it waits until the next measurement interval without taking readings to synchronize with the set time. At each measurement interval, the system checks to see if it has reached the required number of daily measurements (96 mesurements). If it has not, it takes temperature readings from the sensors and records them on the SD card. After each measurement, the system calculates the waiting time until the next measurement and re-enters the low power mode.

When all daily measurements have been completed, the system transmits the accumulated data through LoRa, waits a short period and then resets the measurement counter for the next day. This logic ensures that the system meets the required number of measurements and efficiently manages energy resources, alternating between activity and low-power standby.

To understand better the logic behind the main loop, we recommend you to take a look at the flowchart in ...
