# The MOLONARI sensor installation tutorial
## 1. Prerequisites 
### 1.0. Previously
To carry out this set-up, you'll need a degree in nuclear physics OR (exclusively) two working hands (minimum one)(or feet).
### 1.1.Hardware
- Two [Arduino MKR WAN 1310](https://docs.arduino.cc/hardware/mkr-wan-1310) (data recovery + LoRa transmission)
- Two waterproof antennas (for connection to MKR WAN 1310)
- Featherwing SD- RTC Adalogger Module (connect as per instructions below)
- Micro USB - USB cables or batteries (to power the cards). Note: the USB connection enables power supply and communication with the computer (for the code, and the Serial port). It can also be used to charge a battery connected to the MKR WAN.
### 1.2. Software
- Arduino IDE
- Visual Studio Code (recommended)
On Arduino IDE, make sure you have installed the following libraries:
- Arduino Low Power (deep sleep)
- FlashStorage (Data storage in flash memory)
- LoRa (LoRa communication)
- RTCLib (External real-time clock management)
- RTCZero (Management of the MKR WAN 1310's internal real-time clock) 
- SD (SD card communication)
## 2. Connections
For connections, we strongly advise you to make them on a bread board (in this case, 2 joined together) to ensure very clean connections and avoid having to keep asking yourself whether it's your connections that are causing the problems.

By pinouts we mean the electrical connections between the MKR WAN 1310 (A) and the Featherwing Adalogger (B) (SD + RTC), as well as with the sensors. For greater clarity, you can find pinouts (= maps of the pins on a board) at the following links:
- Pinout MKR WAN 1310→"Pinout+"
- Pinout Featherwing
It's interesting to note that the pins that won't be used on the Featherwing are useless and, above all, connected to nothing. 
So you can run cables on the breadboard lines associated with these pins (which are not pins).

Each step is detailed later, but here's a diagram that sums it all up:

### 2.1. The feed section
Make sure that the battery power supply goes to the Featherwing. 
This means connecting, as shown in diagram 1:
- grounds (GND). 
It is recommended to reserve a line on the breadboard for the use of a common ground (this is a common practice which facilitates wiring and its revision). 
- pin VCC (A) to port 3.3V (B). Same note as for ground: reserve an entire line for this purpose.2.2. 
The SD partThere are 4 pairs of pins to connect to ensure communication:The CS pin selected on (A) (we took the 5)* to the SDCS pin (B) The next 3 pins (they ensure SPI communication) are very technical:(A) SCK-SCK (B)(A) MOSI -MOSI (B)
