## 2. Working with AtmoCONTROL

### 2.1 Starting AtmoCONTROL

It does not allow multiple Windows users to operate on the same computer in parallel. The student account may have limited usage rights, such as being unable to set temperature parameters. Aurelien mentioned that we can use his account temporarily, and he will apply for permissions for us.
